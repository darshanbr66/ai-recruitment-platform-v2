# Test / Demo Credentials (Local Development Only)

These accounts exist in the **local development database** only
(`ai_recruitment_v2` on `localhost:5432`, per `backend/.env`). They are for
frontend/API manual testing. Never use these emails/passwords in a shared or
production environment.

Verified working (`POST /api/v1/recruiter/auth/login` → `200`) on 2026-09-16.

## Notes

- No candidate-portal test accounts exist yet (candidate auth ships in a
  later phase per `docs/architecture.md`).
- Login endpoint: `POST /api/v1/recruiter/auth/login` with `{"email": ..., "password": ...}`.
- If you reseed or reset these accounts, update this file in the same
  change so it keeps matching the local database.
