# Recruitment Workflow

**Implementation status:** The `Application` status model below (§ 2) is
implemented exactly as specified, in `backend/app/workflows/
application_workflow.py`, and is what actually gates every status change in
the app (recruiter-triggered and assessment-triggered alike — see
`app/services/assessment_public_service.py`). `AssessmentInvitation.status`
is a separate, simpler enum (`SENT/STARTED/SUBMITTED/EXPIRED/CANCELLED`)
with its transitions handled directly in `app/services/assessment_service.py`
and `assessment_public_service.py`, not by a dedicated
`invitation_workflow.py` module (that split wasn't warranted at this size —
see `app/models/assessment.py`'s docstring for the full list of
simplifications from the original assessment design). § 5 ("Candidate
portal flow") describes a self-service candidate account that does not
exist yet — see `docs/ai-screening.md`/`docs/assessment.md`/
`docs/campus-hiring.md` implementation-status notes for what candidates
actually get today (an anonymous public apply flow and token-based
assessment links, no login). The anonymous apply flow — email verification,
one-profile-per-person identity rules, submission-time AI screening and HR
override/matching — is § 6.

## 1. Why a workflow module, not scattered status checks

`Application.status` is a finite-state value with rules about which
transitions are legal and who/what can trigger them. Per `CLAUDE.md` § 2
("Workflow state != ad hoc strings"), these rules live in one place:

- `backend/app/workflows/application_workflow.py`

It defines an explicit transition table (`{current_status: {allowed_next
statuses}}`) and a single `transition(application, to_status, actor, reason)`
function that: validates the transition is legal, writes the new status,
and appends an `ApplicationStatusHistory` row — so no call site can move an
application into an invalid state or skip the history write.

## 2. Application status model

```
APPLIED
  → UNDER_REVIEW
  → REJECTED
  → AI_SCREENED_OUT          (system only — submission-time AI screening, § 6)

AI_SCREENED_OUT
  → UNDER_REVIEW             (HR override — reason required, audited)
  → REJECTED                 (HR confirms the screen-out)

UNDER_REVIEW
  → SCREENING
  → REJECTED

SCREENING
  → ASSESSMENT_INVITED       (if an assessment is required for this pipeline)
  → SHORTLISTED              (if no assessment required)
  → REJECTED

ASSESSMENT_INVITED
  → ASSESSMENT_STARTED
  → REJECTED                 (e.g. invitation expired without action — recruiter decision, not automatic)

ASSESSMENT_STARTED
  → ASSESSMENT_COMPLETED
  → REJECTED

ASSESSMENT_COMPLETED
  → SHORTLISTED
  → REJECTED

SHORTLISTED
  → INTERVIEW
  → REJECTED

INTERVIEW
  → SELECTED
  → REJECTED

SELECTED
  → HIRED

REJECTED, HIRED   (terminal)
```

Notes:

- `ASSESSMENT_STARTED`/`ASSESSMENT_COMPLETED` are driven by the assessment
  domain (see `docs/assessment.md`) calling into the workflow module when an
  invitation's `CandidateAttempt` starts/submits — the application workflow
  does not know about assessment internals, it only receives a
  transition request.
- Interview scheduling/feedback is out of scope for the initial phases
  (tracked as a future domain); `INTERVIEW` is a status the recruiter moves
  an application into/out of manually for now.
- `REJECTED`/`HIRED` are terminal — no code path transitions out of them. A
  mis-rejection is corrected by recruiter override (explicit, audited,
  permission-gated), not by "un-terminal-izing" a state silently.
- **`WITHDRAWN` was removed (SIGVITAS platform overhaul):** the platform no
  longer distinguishes a candidate-initiated withdrawal from a recruiter
  rejection — every prior `WITHDRAWN` application became `REJECTED`, and the
  value no longer exists in the enum (application code or database). `HIRED`
  was added as the new outcome after `SELECTED`, matching the product's
  "Selected → Hired" flow.
- **`AI_SCREENED_OUT` is advisory, never final, and system-only.** It is in
  `SYSTEM_ONLY_TARGETS`: only the automatic submission-time screening
  (`actor_user_id=None`) can set it — a person asking for it gets a 409. It
  is deliberately distinct from `REJECTED`. Moving out of it to anything but
  `REJECTED` is an *AI override* (`POST /recruiter/applications/{id}/ai-override`,
  or a normal status change): a reason is mandatory (422 `reason_required`
  otherwise) and an `AI_SCREENING_OVERRIDDEN` activity is recorded with it.
- **`ApplicationSource.HR_MATCH`** marks an application HR created by
  matching an existing candidate to another job (§ 6). It is a source, not a
  status: the new application starts at `APPLIED` like any other.

## 3. Candidate-visible projection

Candidates never see the raw internal status enum value or history reasons.
The candidate API maps internal status to a small, stable public vocabulary:

| Internal status | Candidate sees |
|---|---|
| APPLIED, UNDER_REVIEW | "Application Submitted" |
| SCREENING | "Under Review" |
| ASSESSMENT_INVITED, ASSESSMENT_STARTED | "Assessment Pending" |
| ASSESSMENT_COMPLETED | "Assessment Completed" |
| SHORTLISTED | "Shortlisted" |
| INTERVIEW | "Interview" |
| SELECTED | "Selected" |
| REJECTED | "Not Selected" |
| HIRED | "Hired" |

This mapping lives in the candidate-facing schema/serializer, not in the
workflow module itself — the workflow module's vocabulary is the operational
truth; the candidate projection is a presentation concern.

**Not implemented yet** — there is no candidate portal API (§ 5), so no
status is shown to candidates after they apply, and the table above has no
row for `AI_SCREENED_OUT` yet. What a candidate is told today is only the
submission result of the self-service flow (§ 6): `RECEIVED` or
`NOT_SHORTLISTED_FOR_ROLE`, plus the welcome email. Neither ever names the
internal status, the AI, its score or its reasoning.

## 4. Normal recruitment flow

```
Job created → requirements defined → sourcing/candidate application →
resume upload → resume parsing (Phase 5) → AI-assisted screening (Phase 6) →
recruiter review → assessment (optional) → interview → decision → reports
```

Sourcing is not a distinct backend entity in the initial phases — it is a
recruiter-portal view over candidates/applications filtered by `source` and
by "not yet applied" status, plus manual candidate add. If sourcing grows
dedicated needs (outreach sequences, external sourcing integrations), it
becomes its own domain at that point rather than being speculatively modeled
now.

## 5. Candidate portal flow

```
Browse public jobs → job details → Apply → register/login → complete profile →
upload resume → submit application → view status → (assessment if invited) →
interview → final decision
```

The "Apply" action from a public job detail page, if the visitor isn't
authenticated, routes through candidate register/login and returns to
complete the application — the Job the candidate was applying to is
preserved across that redirect (client-side state), not silently dropped.

## 6. Candidate intake (self-service application) — implemented

What a candidate actually does today, with no account: apply from the public
careers site, or from a campus drive link (`docs/campus-hiring.md` § 3).
Both entry points run the same code, `app/services/public_application_service.py`,
so the identity rules below are identical for both.

```
verify email (one-time code) → fill the full form + resume → identity check
(one profile per person) → Candidate + Application + resume COMMITTED →
AI screening against the job → MATCH / AI unavailable: APPLIED
                              → NOT_MATCH: AI_SCREENED_OUT (kept, HR can override)
→ welcome email (both outcomes)
```

**1. Email verification (required).** The candidate asks for a 6-digit code
and then confirms it. Confirming it returns a short-lived verification token,
which the application form must send back. The browser never holds a
"verified" flag of its own. Everything is enforced server-side in
`app/services/email_verification_service.py`, and its state is stored in the
tenant-scoped `email_verifications` table:

- the code is stored only as an HMAC keyed with the server secret, and the
  token only as its SHA-256. Neither is ever stored in plain text;
- a code expires (`EMAIL_OTP_TTL_MINUTES`) and allows a limited number of
  wrong guesses (`EMAIL_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`), after which a new code is needed;
- resending has a cooldown (`EMAIL_OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`), and each
  email address has an hourly send cap (`EMAIL_OTP_MAX_SENDS_PER_HOUR`);
- the token expires (`EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES`) and is bound to
  one organization and one email address. It is used up by a successful
  submission, and also by a submission blocked as a duplicate, so it can't
  be replayed to test other mobile numbers;
- per-IP budgets apply in front of all of this
  (`PUBLIC_OTP_REQUEST_LIMIT_PER_WINDOW`, `PUBLIC_OTP_VERIFY_LIMIT_PER_WINDOW`,
  `PUBLIC_APPLY_LIMIT_PER_WINDOW`, per 10-minute window, per instance).

Asking for a code never reveals whether the address already has a profile.
Once the code is confirmed, the caller has proven they own the address, so
an existing candidate is told at that point (409 `already_registered`) rather
than after filling in the form.

**2. The form.** All of these are mandatory: full name, email, mobile
number, date of birth (at least 16 years old), place of birth, languages
known (1–15), candidate type, current and preferred location, qualification,
LinkedIn and GitHub URLs, and a resume. The database enforces the identity
part: `ck_candidates_verified_identity_complete` means a candidate with
`email_verified_at` set always has a phone, date of birth, place of birth and
at least one language. Recruiter-created candidates don't go through
verification, so for them these fields stay optional.

**3. Identity: one profile per person, one self-service application.**
Within an organization, a person is identified by email and by mobile
number. Mobile numbers are normalized to E.164 with `phonenumbers`
(`app/core/phone.py`). A number typed without a country code is read in
`DEFAULT_PHONE_REGION`, so "98765 43210", "09876543210" and "+91 98765-43210"
all count as the same person. The unique index `uq_candidates_org_phone` on
`(organization_id, phone)` enforces this. If either detail matches an
existing candidate, the submission is refused with a message that doesn't
say which detail matched and points to the organization's careers contact.
Nothing is created, and a `DUPLICATE_APPLICATION_BLOCKED` activity is
recorded on the existing profile for HR. Further roles also come from HR
(step 6).

**3a. The reapply window.** A candidate who has applied before may
self-apply again once `CANDIDATE_REAPPLY_COOLDOWN_MONTHS` (default 3)
calendar months have passed since their previous *self-service*
application. The rule lives in `app/services/reapply_service.py`:

- it reuses the same Candidate profile — no duplicate is created, and every
  previous application and its screening history is preserved;
- only self-service applications count. A candidate HR created, imported or
  matched to a role has no self-apply history and is never locked out by it;
- every self-service application counts whatever its status
  (`AI_SCREENED_OUT` included) and even if archived: the window is about
  when the person last applied, not how it went;
- inside the window the submission is refused with 409 `reapply_locked`,
  carrying `last_applied_at` and `eligible_from`. The candidate is told
  plainly when they can apply again. This is only ever raised to someone who
  has just verified their own email address, so naming their dates is safe;
- a `DUPLICATE_APPLICATION_BLOCKED` activity is recorded for HR, and the
  email verification token is used up, so it can't be replayed.

**HR override ("Allow Reapply").** `POST /api/v1/recruiter/candidates/{id}/reapply-grants`
(`candidate.reapply.grant`, reason required) records a `CandidateReapplyGrant`
letting that candidate self-apply once before the window ends. It is
single-use: their next self-service application stamps `used_at` and
`used_by_application_id`, after which the normal window applies again. At
most one grant may be open per candidate. Rows are never deleted — with the
`CANDIDATE_REAPPLY_GRANTED` / `CANDIDATE_REAPPLY_GRANT_USED` activities they
are the audit trail of who allowed what, when and why. Existing applications
are untouched. `GET .../reapply-status` reports the window and any open
grant.

**4. Commit first, then screen.** The candidate, application and resume are
committed *before* the AI call and before any email. A slow or failed model,
or a failed email, can never lose an application.

**5. Submission-time AI screening.** The resume is screened against the
job's description by the configured `LLMProvider` (`docs/ai-screening.md`).
The `ScreeningRun` records `decision` (`MATCH` / `NOT_MATCH`) and the
`matched_requirements` / `missing_requirements` lists.

- `MATCH`: the application stays `APPLIED` for recruiter review, and the
  candidate is told `RECEIVED`.
- `NOT_MATCH`: the system moves it to `AI_SCREENED_OUT` (§ 2). It is kept
  and visible to HR, and the candidate is told `NOT_SHORTLISTED_FOR_ROLE`.
- AI unconfigured or failing: the application stays `APPLIED` and an
  `AI_SCREENING_FAILED` activity is recorded. A failure never screens anyone
  out; a person decides.

In every case the candidate gets a welcome email. The screened-out version
says the profile isn't eligible for this particular role and is retained for
others. Neither version mentions AI, a score or reasons. Both use the
organization's `careers_contact_email` as reply-to and contact address,
when one is set. A failed email is recorded as an activity and never undoes
the application.

**6. HR decisions.**

- *Override:* `POST /api/v1/recruiter/applications/{id}/ai-override`
  (`application.status.change`, reason required) moves an `AI_SCREENED_OUT`
  application to `UNDER_REVIEW`. HR can instead confirm it as `REJECTED`.
- *Match to another job:* `POST /api/v1/recruiter/candidates/{id}/job-matches`
  (`application.create`) creates a *new* `HR_MATCH` application for the same
  candidate. The candidate's latest resume is attached to it, and the job
  must be `OPEN`, `DRAFT` or `ON_HOLD`. The original application is left
  untouched, and matching the same job twice returns 409.
- *History:* `GET /api/v1/recruiter/candidates/{id}/history` (needs both
  `candidate.read` and `screening.read`) returns every application, flagging
  the original one, with its screening runs and an activity timeline.
- *Add a resume + applying role:* `POST /api/v1/recruiter/candidates/{id}/applications`
  (`application.create`, multipart: `job_id`, `resume`, `run_screening`)
  creates a `RECRUITER_ADDED` application and runs the same AI screening
  gate a self-service submission gets — MATCH stays `APPLIED` for review,
  NOT_MATCH becomes `AI_SCREENED_OUT`, an AI failure leaves it `APPLIED`.
  It composes the existing pieces (`application_service.create_application`,
  `resume_service.save_resume`, `public_application_service.screen_new_application`)
  rather than duplicating them. If the candidate already has a resume-less
  application for that role, the resume is filled in there instead of a
  second one being created. No candidate OTP is involved: HR is
  authenticated staff acting within their own organization, and because the
  application is not self-service it never touches the reapply window.

All of these endpoints are tenant-scoped. An id from another organization
returns 404, exactly like an id that doesn't exist.

**7. Careers contact.** `organizations.careers_contact_email` is the
recruitment team's public contact address. Only a SUPER_ADMIN sets it
(`PATCH /api/v1/admin/organizations/{id}`; `null` un-publishes it). It is
published through `GET /api/v1/public/organizations/{slug}`, and it is never
hardcoded.
