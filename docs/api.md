# API Architecture

Status: Implemented for the domains that exist (auth, admin/organizations,
recruiter jobs/candidates/applications/reports/screening/assessments/
campus-drives/notes, public career site + apply + assessment-taking). No
`/api/v1/candidate/*` audience exists yet — there is no candidate portal
login (see `docs/recruitment-workflow.md`'s implementation-status note).
The versioning/audience-partitioning convention below is exactly what's
implemented; the endpoint list further down predates several of the
domains actually built and was not kept in lockstep with every new route —
`GET /api/v1/*/openapi.json` (or `/docs`) is the authoritative live list.

## 1. Versioning & audience partitioning

All routes are under `/api/v1/`, further partitioned by audience so the
authorization requirement is visible from the URL:

```
/api/v1/public/...      anonymous
/api/v1/candidate/...   candidate JWT (audience="candidate")
/api/v1/assessment/...  invitation bearer token (not a login session)
/api/v1/recruiter/...   staff JWT (audience="user") + role/permission check
/api/v1/admin/...       staff JWT, SUPER_ADMIN only
```

A route handler never has to guess its own trust level — the prefix is the
contract, enforced by a FastAPI dependency attached at the router level for
each prefix (not per-endpoint, to avoid one endpoint being forgotten).

## 2. Representative endpoint surface (illustrative — finalized per-phase)

### Public
```
GET  /api/v1/public/organizations/{org_slug}/jobs
GET  /api/v1/public/organizations/{org_slug}/jobs/{job_id}
POST /api/v1/public/organizations/{org_slug}/jobs/{job_id}/apply   (multipart)
```
`apply` takes `full_name`, `email`, `resume` plus optional profile fields:
`candidate_type` (`FRESHER`|`EXPERIENCED`), `years_experience`,
`notice_period_days`, `immediate_joiner`, `current_title`, `current_company`,
`current_location`, `preferred_location`, `qualification`, `linkedin_url`,
`github_url`. `EXPERIENCED` requires `years_experience` and either
`notice_period_days` or `immediate_joiner`; a `FRESHER` is stored with 0 years
and no notice period; profile URLs must be http(s) on linkedin.com /
github.com. Profile data lands on the (tenant-scoped) Candidate; an existing
candidate's already-filled fields are never overwritten by an anonymous
submission.

Only published (`status=OPEN`) jobs, minimal fields (title, department,
location, employment_type, description, requirements summary).

### Candidate
```
POST /api/v1/candidate/auth/register
POST /api/v1/candidate/auth/login
POST /api/v1/candidate/auth/refresh
POST /api/v1/candidate/auth/logout
GET  /api/v1/candidate/me
PATCH /api/v1/candidate/me
POST /api/v1/candidate/me/resume
GET  /api/v1/candidate/applications
POST /api/v1/candidate/jobs/{job_id}/apply
GET  /api/v1/candidate/applications/{application_id}
```
Application detail exposes a candidate-safe status view (current stage,
timestamps) — never raw internal `ApplicationStatusHistory.reason`,
recruiter notes, or AI evaluation evidence.

### Assessment (token-bearer, not session-based)
```
GET  /api/v1/assessment/invitations/{token}
POST /api/v1/assessment/invitations/{token}/start
POST /api/v1/assessment/invitations/{token}/answers
POST /api/v1/assessment/invitations/{token}/submit
```
`{token}` is the raw invitation token; the server looks it up by
`sha256(token)` against `assessment_invitations.token_hash`. See
`docs/assessment.md` and `docs/security.md` for the full token lifecycle.

### Recruiter
```
GET/POST      /api/v1/recruiter/jobs
GET/PATCH     /api/v1/recruiter/jobs/{job_id}
GET/POST      /api/v1/recruiter/candidates

### Applications list (`GET /api/v1/recruiter/applications`)

One endpoint serves the Applications page, a Campus Drive's "Candidates in this
drive" (`campus_drive_id`), a candidate's own applications (`candidate_id`) and
reports. Everything is decided server-side; paging is applied **after**
filtering. The body is a plain list; the number of matches ignoring paging is
in the **`X-Total-Count`** response header (exposed through CORS).

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `q` | Up to 5 words (max 100 chars); **every** word must match the candidate's name, email or phone (digits-only comparison, so `98765 43210` finds `+91 98765-43210`) **or** the job title. `%` and `_` are literal. |
| `job_id`, `status`, `source`, `campus_drive_id`, `candidate_id` | Exact matches. `status` and `source` are enums (`PORTAL`, `RECRUITER_ADDED`, `CAMPUS_IMPORT`, `REFERRAL`, `OTHER`); unknown values are a 422. |
| `candidate_type` | `FRESHER` / `EXPERIENCED`. |
| `current_title`, `current_company`, `location` (current), `preferred_location`, `qualification` | Case-insensitive "contains" (max 255). |
| `min_experience`, `max_experience` | Years, 0–80, inclusive. Candidates with no experience recorded never match a bound. `min > max` is a 422. |
| `max_notice_period_days` | "Up to N days", 0–365. Candidates with no notice period recorded don't match. |
| `immediate_joiner` | `true` / `false`. |
| `applied_from`, `applied_to` | `YYYY-MM-DD`, whole days in **UTC**, both ends inclusive. `from > to` is a 422. |
| `sort_by`, `sort_dir` | `created_at` (default) / `applied_at` / `candidate_name` / `job_title` / `status` (pipeline order, not alphabetical); `asc` / `desc` (default `desc`). Ties are broken by id, so pages never repeat or skip rows. |
| `limit`, `offset` | `limit` 1–100; **omitted = every match** (internal callers such as reports rely on it). `offset` ≥ 0. |

All filters combine with AND. Deleted applications are never returned. Rows
also carry `candidate_phone`. Results are always scoped to the caller's
organization (query + RLS).

All resolve `organization_id` from the authenticated principal — never from
a path/query/body parameter — and enforce the specific permission for the
action via a dependency (e.g. `require_permission("application.status.change")`).

### Admin
```
GET/POST /api/v1/admin/organizations
PATCH    /api/v1/admin/organizations/{org_id}
```

## 3. Conventions

- **Errors**: consistent envelope —
  `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "request_id": "..."}}` with
  the correct HTTP status. No internal exception messages or stack traces in
  the body; those go to structured logs keyed by `request_id`.
- **Pagination**: cursor or offset/limit (finalized in Phase 3 when the first
  list endpoints ship), consistent shape:
  `{"items": [...], "total": N, "next_cursor": "..."}`.
- **Validation**: every request/response is a Pydantic model; no raw `dict`
  bodies.
- **HTTP status codes**: `201` on resource creation, `204` on
  no-content-success (e.g. delete), `409` on conflict (e.g. duplicate
  application), `422` on validation error (FastAPI default), `403` vs `404`
  chosen deliberately for cross-tenant access attempts (see
  `docs/security.md` — default to `404` for resources outside the caller's
  tenant, to avoid confirming existence).
- **Idempotency**: bulk operations (e.g. bulk assessment invitation send)
  accept a client-supplied idempotency key to make retries safe.
