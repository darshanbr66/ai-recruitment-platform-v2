        This assessment uses browser-based monitoring to protect assessment integrity. During the
        assessment, the following may be recorded with a timestamp and reviewed by the recruitment
        team:
      </p>
      <ul className="check-list">
        <li>Camera and microphone permission, and whether they become unavailable</li>
        <li>Camera/microphone device changes (e.g. unplugging a webcam)</li>
        <li>Switching away from this tab or window</li>
        <li>Exiting fullscreen, if fullscreen is in use</li>
        <li>Internet connection interruptions</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="field-hint">
        We do not record or store audio or video — only the events above, with a timestamp. Camera
        and microphone access (if you grant it) is used solely to detect whether they're available;
        no stream is captured.
