# AI Recruitment Platform

A multi-tenant recruitment intelligence platform covering recruiter-side
hiring workflows (jobs, candidates, applications, AI screening, assessments,
campus hiring, reporting) and a public candidate-facing career site/apply
flow.

**Status:** Local development demo. Working end-to-end: staff auth (with
org/tenant isolation via Postgres RLS), Jobs/Candidates/Applications CRUD
and pipeline, a public career site with resume upload, AI-assisted resume
screening, MCQ assessments with token-based candidate access (no login
required), campus drives, application notes, live reports, and outbound
template-based candidate email (Resend over HTTPS in production, SMTP for local development). Recruiter email is **manual**: a
recruiter picks one of six professional HTML templates (application received,
interview invitation, assessment invitation, next steps, rejection, general),
edits it if needed, previews it, and sends. Assigning an assessment and
changing a status never send email on their own. The only automatic emails
are the two system emails of the candidate intake flow: the email
verification code, and the welcome email after a self-service application.
The same composer is also
available as a general **Email** page for messages that aren't tied to an
application. The Team page shows a live organization chart built from the
organization's departments and employees. Employees appear in a stored order —
new employees are added at the end of their department, and an org admin can
drag them (or use the arrow keys on the drag handle) to rearrange a department;
the position itself is internal and never shown. An org admin can also delete
activity entries in bulk (a selection, or every entry of their own organization).

**Candidate intake** (careers site and campus drive links, no account): the
candidate first verifies their email with a one-time code, then fills in a
mandatory form (including mobile number, date of birth, place of birth and
languages known) and uploads a resume. Each person gets one profile and one
self-service application per organization, matched by email or mobile
number. Mobile numbers are normalized, so "98765 43210" and "+91
98765-43210" are the same person. The application is saved first, then
AI-screened against the job. A non-match becomes `AI_SCREENED_OUT`: it is
kept and HR can override it (with a reason) or reject it. HR can also match
the candidate to other jobs (a new `HR_MATCH` application) and see their
full history. Each organization's public careers contact address
(`careers_contact_email`, set by a super admin) is shown to candidates. See
[`docs/recruitment-workflow.md`](docs/recruitment-workflow.md) § 6.

The visual language, motion rules, the lazy-loaded 3D landing hero (with its
static fallback) and the accessibility approach are described in
[`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md).

Local test accounts are in [`docs/TEST_CREDENTIALS.md`](docs/TEST_CREDENTIALS.md).
No candidate portal (self-service login/profile) yet — candidates interact
anonymously via the public apply flow and assessment invitation links.
See `docs/architecture.md` for the original full design and phase plan, and
the "Implementation status" note at the top of each of the docs below for
how the current build compares to that original design (some domains were
intentionally simplified for the local MVP — see each doc for specifics).

## Running locally

Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, Node 20+, a PostgreSQL 16+ instance with the
`vector` (pgvector) extension enabled, and a dedicated database/role for
this project (see `backend/.env.example`).

**Backend**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/pip install -e ".[dev]"     # ./.venv/bin/pip on macOS/Linux
cp .env.example .env                         # then fill in real values
PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 ./.venv/Scripts/python -m alembic upgrade head
./.venv/Scripts/python run.py                # dev server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

`run.py` (not a plain `uvicorn app.main:app`) is the local dev entrypoint on
Windows — see the comment in that file for why. On Linux/containers,
`uvicorn app.main:app` works directly.

On Windows, `python -m alembic <command>` occasionally aborts silently
(exit code 127, no output) the first time it's invoked after a fresh
interpreter/DB state — this is an observed interaction between psycopg3's
async mode and the greenlet bridge Alembic uses to run its (synchronous)
migration operations, not an application bug. Running with
`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1` set reliably avoids it; harmless to leave set for
every Alembic invocation on Windows.

Optional environment variables (`backend/.env`, see `.env.example` for the
full list) enable outbound email and AI screening; the app runs fully
without them — both features fail with a clear "not configured" message
rather than faking success/results:

| Variable | Enables |
|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` (default `587`), `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`, `SMTP_USE_TLS` (default `true`) | Outbound email over SMTP for the recruiter's manual "Send Email" / "Send Assessment Invitation" actions, and for the candidate intake system emails (verification code, welcome email). Without email configured, candidates can't verify their address, so self-service applications can't be submitted. `SMTP_PASSWORD` is a secret — keep it in your local `.env` / the host's secret store only, never in source or `.env.example`. With any of host/username/password/from-address missing, sends fail with a clear `email_not_configured` error. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` | Outbound email over HTTPS via [Resend](https://resend.com) — **the production provider** (hosts like Render's free web services block outbound SMTP ports). When both are set, Resend is used in preference to SMTP. `RESEND_API_KEY` is a secret. `EMAIL_FROM` must be an address on a domain verified in Resend, e.g. `SIGVITAS <hr@yourdomain.com>`. Leave both empty locally to keep using SMTP. |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (+ `OLLAMA_MODEL`) | AI-assisted resume screening via a **free, local** [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model — no API key, nothing leaves your machine. Preferred over the paid options below when set. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` *or* `OPENAI_API_KEY` | AI-assisted resume screening via a paid cloud provider, if you'd rather not run Ollama. Only used when `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` isn't set. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` (+ `GEMINI_MODEL`, `SIGVI_*`) | **Sigvi**, the public AI assistant on the careers site, via Google Gemini's free tier ([get a key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)). Without it the assistant says it's temporarily unavailable; the rest of the site is unaffected. The same key is the **last-fallback resume screening provider**, used when none of the above is set ([`docs/ai-screening.md`](docs/ai-screening.md)). `GEMINI_API_KEY` is a secret. See [`docs/sigvi.md`](docs/sigvi.md). |
| `DEFAULT_PHONE_REGION` (default `IN`), `EMAIL_OTP_*`, `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES`, `PUBLIC_*_LIMIT_PER_WINDOW` | Candidate intake tuning: the region assumed for mobile numbers typed without a country code, the email one-time-code expiry, attempt and resend limits, and per-IP request budgets. All have safe defaults (listed in `.env.example`). |

## Working on this project

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) first — it holds the binding project rules,
non-negotiable domain principles, and the recorded architectural decisions.
Implementation proceeds in the phases listed in `docs/architecture.md` § 12;
each phase is scoped, implemented, tested, and reported before the next one
starts.
