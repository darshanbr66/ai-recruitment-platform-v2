"""merge WITHDRAWN into REJECTED, add HIRED application status

Revision ID: c1a2f3b4d5e6
Revises: 7b8857298c92
Create Date: 2026-09-18 12:00:00.000000

Product decision (see CLAUDE.md / SIGVITAS platform overhaul): the
recruiter-facing workflow no longer distinguishes "Rejected" from
"Withdrawn" — every application previously in WITHDRAWN is data-migrated to
REJECTED, and the value is removed from the native Postgres
`application_status` enum entirely (not just hidden in application code),
so no trace of it remains in the DB schema either. `HIRED` is added as the
new terminal state reachable only from SELECTED (docs/recruitment-workflow.md
§ 2), matching the platform's "Selected -> Hired" hiring-outcome flow.

Postgres has no `ALTER TYPE ... DROP VALUE`, so this uses the standard
rename-old-type / create-new-type / cast-columns / drop-old-type pattern,
applied to both `applications.status` and
`application_status_history.from_status`/`to_status` (all three columns
share the same enum type).
