"""The predefined candidate-email templates.

These are code-defined constants: a recruiter editing an email edits *that
email's* subject/body in the request, never the template itself, so the
defaults are always the same professional starting point.

Body syntax (plain text, so it stays easy to edit in a textarea):

* Blank line -> paragraph break.
* A paragraph whose lines all read ``Label: value`` (optionally preceded by a
  short heading line) is rendered as a details table.
* A paragraph whose lines all start with ``- `` is rendered as a list.
* ``{{placeholder}}`` is replaced from the application context or the
  recruiter's template fields (see ``rendering.py``). A line that contains a
  placeholder with no value is dropped, so optional details never leave a
  dangling label or a raw ``{{...}}`` in the sent email.
