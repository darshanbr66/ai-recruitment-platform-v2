"""Activity/audit trail (app/models/activity.py). Every write goes through
`record_activity` — nothing else inserts into this table, and nothing ever
updates a row. The one removal path is `delete_activity`, reachable only
through the ORG_ADMIN-gated `activity.delete` permission and always scoped
to the caller's own organization; each removal is written to the
structured application log so it is never wholly untraceable (CLAUDE.md
§ 3)."""
