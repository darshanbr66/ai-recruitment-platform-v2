"""Employee directory management for the Team Hierarchy feature (SIGVITAS
platform overhaul § 9-11). `organization_id` always comes from the
authenticated caller, never the request. Deliberately separate from
`app/api/v1/recruiter/users.py` (portal login + RBAC) — most employees
here have no portal account at all."""
